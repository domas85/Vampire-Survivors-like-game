# **This is from the first course at Futuregames.**

It is from the "Game Programming with C#" course. We were tasked with making a Vampire Survivors like game that was split into 3 assignments.



**The first assignment focused on the basics of the game like:**
- Movement
- Combat
- Enemies


**The second focused more on making it interactive for example:**
- Health
- Main menu
- More enemies


**The third focused more on the game loop like:**
- UI
- Upgrades
- Progression

These were the tasks to do while working on the game. For this course, all of us were working on their own individual project. And this is the final game I sent in at the end of the course 2024/10/11.
